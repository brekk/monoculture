 - [x] we need to deal with topological sorting w/r/t async, I would guess this is not correct / timely, but not certain. **Complete!** we're using @hapi/topo for now, it has a nice feature set but it is a little inelegant
 - [x] we need to have the same automatic segmentation that happens to `state` happen for pulling `config`. Things like `robot-tourist` have a lot of knobs / configuration, that should be easily segmented or made accessible through `monorail` **Complete!** Now the rulefile can contain configuration details which get passed along to plugins and are accessible via the `config` helper
 - [ ] we should have some shit for TS, even though it is a garbage type system of garbage -- `remeda`?
   - [ ] can we automate this magically?
 - [ ] we need to build rules / `manacle`
 - [x] we need to support rulefiles (the combination of configuration for `monocle` so you can have repeatable runs / diarrhea) **Complete!** This works pretty well, and leverages `climate` very easily
 - [ ] would it make sense to combine `monocle` + `monorail`? Or, framed differently, what will `monorail` be used for elsewhere?
 - [ ] `clox` could support subdividable space
 - [ ] `robot-tourist` should have more tests because it has some edges which don't fully remove / clean JS/TS syntax
 - [ ] `superorganism` needs more work -- if we're gonna re-imagine how `nps` config files are, we may need a backwards-compatible legacy mode, or we're already pretty coupled with `nps` in most of these packages.
 - [ ] `treacle` should maybe eventually be wired to the new `gitparty`
 - [ ] `doctor-general` has some edges which either aren't well documented or have bad defaults (specifically, `@page` + `@pageSummary` stuff right now), we should clean that up so that we have better automatically generated content
 - [ ] `doctor-general` needs to have `@group` and `@addTo` documented (and tests updated)
 - [ ] `doctor-general` hangs indefinitely on inline `{@link hookInfo}` stuff
 - [x] In the same way we do `/src` we should probably use a pattern like `/dist` for artifacts, it would help disambiguate and signal intent very easily. **Complete!** We have migrated everything to use a `/dist` pattern
 - [ ] We can likely save more on repeated configuration by consolidating things (either on `nps` or `superorganism`)
 - [-] Add a utility library for some basics, like strings, arrays, Sets + Maps - **Updated!** We have `knot` for strings.
 - [ ] Let's do some stuff with `transduce`!
 - [ ] Right now we're using a build step on everything, but we should move to pure ESM for anything in `packages` (or similar)
