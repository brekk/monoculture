# `daffy-doc`
_A tool for automatic code generation_

We've elected to use `jsdoc` style comments plus a few custom additions so that we can have documentation which is co-located with the code it describes. A more thorough summary of `jsdoc` and its usage can be found at this [link](https://jsdoc.app)

Since we are leveraging TypeScript in several of these packages and it already affords certain aspects of what a function / model needs in terms of inputs and outputs, on the whole we have eschewed using `@param` or `@return` values by convention.

However, there are a few custom additions which require additional context to use effectively.

## Usage

### Adding documentation

Let's say you have a simple function and it looks like this:

```ts
const add = (x: number) => (y: number) => x + y
```

In order to add comments that `daffy-doc` can pick up, the comments must start with `/**` (note the two asterisks), end with `*/` (as all multiline comments must) and have a leading `*` per line.

So for `add` in the example above, we'd add a comment like something like:
```ts
/**
 * Adds two numbers together. Manually curried.
 * @name add
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const five = add(5)
 * [1,2,3,4,5].map(five)
 * ```
 */
const add = (x: number) => (y: number) => x + y
```

☝️  Note that we have a description (first line, untagged), an explicit `@name` and an `@example` here.

This is then consumed by `daffy-doc` downstream, and it will spit out a JSON file with a lot of entries that look like:

```
[
  {
    "filename": "packages/my-cool-package/math.ts",
    "comments": [
      {
        "start": 24,
        "end": 32,
        "lines": [
          "Adds two numbers together. Manually curried.",
          "@name add",
          "@example",
          "```ts",
          "const five = add(5)",
          "[1,2,3,4,5].map(five)"
          "```"
        ],
        "summary": "Adds two numbers together. Manually curried.",
        "links": [],
        "structure": {
          "name": "add",
          "example": "```ts\nconst five = add(5)\n[1,2,3,4,5].map(five)\n```"
        },
        "keywords": [
          "@example",
          "@name",
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Adding documentation for a component

Let's say you have a simple `react` component and it looks kinda like this:

```tsx
import {chakra} from "@chakra-ui/react"

interface CCProps {
  children: ReactNode
}
export const CustomComponent = ({children}: CCProps) => <chakra.strong>{children}</chakra.strong>
```

To add documentation which `daffy-doc` can understand and auto generate, (including a live example), you'd want to do something like this:

```tsx
import {chakra} from "@chakra-ui/react"

interface CCProps {
  children: ReactNode
}
/**
 * This Component is an example. It probably shouldn't be a custom component IRL!
 * @name CustomComponent
 * @example
 * ```tsx live=true
 * import { CustomComponent } from "ui-scaffold/components/Custom"
 *  
 * <CustomComponent>{`Hey there`}</CustomComponent>
 * ```
 */
export const CustomComponent = ({children}: CCProps) => (
  <chakra.strong>{children}</chakra.strong>
)
```

☝️  Some important things to remember when making documentation with a live example:

1. `live=true` is a specific thing needed if you want `docs` to render your component
2. Note that the import is from `"ui-scaffold"` even though (ostensibly) this component + documentation is located _in_ `packages/ui-scaffold`. That's because this comment is magically whisked away and copied to `apps/docs`, so all of your paths should be written as though you're in the `docs` folder.
3. The empty line between the `import` and the raw TSX is essential (without it you get a weird MDX error that is kinda inscrutable. See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for more information.
4. MDX only allows for JSX expressions, not JS nor TS. So you cannot save a variable and re-use it, for instance.

### Re-generating documentation

`yarn workspace docs run autodoc` should be all that is required when you change any file in any workspace (unless it's within the `daffy-doc` itself) to add magic / `jsdoc` style comments. But if something is broken, see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

Additionally, `daffy-doc` generates a file in `apps/docs` which is `daffy-doc-generated.json`, in the even of an error it might be a useful diagnostic to see what `daffy-doc` parsed relative to what you wrote.

### Custom Page Names

In any file you can rename the resulting documentation title with a `@page` tag anywhere in the document

```
/**
 * @Page My really cool page
 */
```

### Troubleshooting
#### MDX

This is a very useful page for [understanding MDX errors](https://mdxjs.com/docs/troubleshooting-mdx/#problems-writing-mdx). In general if you have a class of errors here, your best bet is to play around with the `.mdx` file that `daffy-doc` generated.

### Roadmap

#### Future improvements

 1. Update `daffy-doc` to be more aware of `nextra` routing so that we can control pathing more in a more granular fashion.
 2. Allow for logical grouping of entries.
 3. Update `daffy-doc` to do double-duty on `live=true` examples; make it so that the examples can function as tests (and thus be provably incorrect over time)
