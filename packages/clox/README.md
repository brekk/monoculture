This is a rework of `boxen` because the newer version of [gitparty](https://github.com/brekk/monoculture/tree/main/tools/gitparty) had a need for more complex boxes (including a footer and forthcoming box subdivision).

NB: ANSI and string length (esp. when dealing with emoji / non-latin characters) are more complicated than you may think.
