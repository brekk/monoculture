# robot-tourist

`robot-tourist` is a tool which leverages a word stemmer and some categorization and statistics for JavaScript + TypeScript files. It is intended to provide an intentionally uninformed examination of source code. It was originally prompted by having to navigate a legacy codebase which had very verbose (but not particularly informative) naming conventions.

It pairs well with [monocle](https://github.com/brekk/monoculture/blob/main/packages/monocle) as a plugin but it can also be used on its own.
